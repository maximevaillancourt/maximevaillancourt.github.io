    recently upgraded thermal paste.  The display panel, bezel, palm wrest, and trackpad
    have all seen better days, but, this thing is a veritable workhorse that won&#39;t
    die!  I have the ultrabase with the key, the external battery charger, and every

    by the with factory wireless card.  I was just marveling at how this thing keeps
    going and going, switched over this morning to do some work from my brand new
    Dell desktop, and did a Google search for &quot;still using my X220&quot; and
    your post came out on top.  Once we were trying to watch something with a bluetooth
    speaker and my daughter said, &quot;It seems like your notebook is trusty.&quot;  Well-said!  You
    helped pin down some of the reasons for this.  I think a big part of it is the
    user-serviceability and the connectivity.

  body: "Hello, I like your post about X220. I also just buy 2nd hand with 128GB SSD
    and 8gb of ram, i7-2640m. I can get 3-4 hours of battery, I plan to optimize it
    further. I read many source online at prime, thinkpad X220 could work for 8 hours
    minimum with 44wh battery, and I hope it comes true, because I want to buy a new
    battery for it. Now I&#39;ve 9 cell battery, but it seems it&#39;s not original
    (and hard to pass by, and not cheap), so I only got 3-4 hours I mention before,
    light browsing with FF on windows 10 20h2, writing word, etc. I dream this laptop
    for long time until I could get it.. In my country I need to pay installment (yeah,
    my monthly payment as uni lecturer is very low indeed), it cost me 252 USD and
    each month for 21 USD (it&#39;s a lot here, you could buy one month meal with
    that, with 1 full meal a day). \r\n\r\nI hope this machine could hold 10 years
    a head, as I still have lenovo netbook S10 on my uni lab, it still work good,
    just not for web browsing, but remote, code, run simple code, compile, hear music,
    it still work for 7 hours straight. I really amazed with well cared old laptop,
    that aging well. Thank you for sharing!"

    up on a github with a list of 2nd brains. Scrolled through it, and saw a familiar

    it too). \r\n\r\nThen i saw you had a guestbook .. which is amazing too. \r\n\r\nThe
    i saw everyone on the guestbook talking about your dumb-phone idea. \r\nI had
    a look - and i hope you were able to maintain a more mindful relation with your
    phone. \r\n\r\nI personally went through a lot of digital-minimalism through the
